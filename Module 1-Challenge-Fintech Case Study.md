# TITLE-Module 1- Challenge- Stripe, Inc. Case Study

## Overview and Origin:
The dawning of the 21st century will be recognized for many disruptive changes that manifested through ground breaking technology. The application of these technologies has had a profound effect on the financial industry in particular. With a seemingly growing demand for financial organizations to augment and streamline financial services, the innovative technological solutions have become synonymous with the financial industry; therefore, leading to the new term “FinTech” or Financial Technology. The emergence of the FinTech industry has provided new opportunities to many new and existing companies ready to offer these innovative financial solutions. One such company is Stripe, Inc. 

* Name of company
Stripe, Inc has grown into a global financial technology company that provides a suite of online payment processing services for businesses. 

* When was the company incorporated?

* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
At an early age Patrick and John Collison recognized the current trend of the internet on business was transforming contemporary commerce and saw a need to bridge the gap to simplify the payment infrastructure to support this shift in consumer tastes.
“The inspiration for Stripe can be traced back to their frustration with the complexity and challenges associated with accepting online payments. Patrick and John Collison recognized the difficulties that businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, faced in setting up and managing online payment systems. Traditional payment processors often had complex integration processes, cumbersome paperwork, and high barriers to entry, making it challenging for developers and businesses to incorporate payment solutions into their websites and applications.
In interviews and discussions, the Collison brothers have mentioned that the initial idea for Stripe was born out of a desire to simplify the online payment process. They envisioned a platform that would make it easy for developers to integrate payment functionality seamlessly, without the need for extensive knowledge of financial systems or dealing with the complexities of traditional payment gateways.” (1)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The organization’s initial seed funding was estimated to be $2 million by luminary investors Peter Theil, Elon Musk and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as other angel investors. Stripe also received investment funding from venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital. 
Payment processor Stripe raised $6.5 billion at a $50 billion valuation, a sharp discount from its record valuation of $95 billion in 2021. “Stripe does not need this capital to run its business,” the company said in a press release. (2)

Where once “traditional online payment processing had become very complex, merchants were forced to navigate intricate systems and integrate multiple tools” (6) in order to accept online payments. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Stripe, Inc.’s intended customers are businesses and organizations primary engaged in online commerce.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Since Stripe, Inc. is a privately held company, its financials are not public record at this time. The limited access to this information makes it difficult to calculate some of these metrics year over year and thereby attempting to measure performance through these metrics will require some creativity. For instance, “Stripe’s gross revenue is a fraction of its GMV. Stripe’s standard fee structure is 2.9%+ $0.30—in other words, 2.9% of each dollar processed plus $0.30 for each transaction. This fee structure (which is likely discounted for its larger customers) generates most of Stripe’s gross revenue. Stripe then pays a large portion of this gross revenue to the card networks, banks, and acquirer processors, leaving it with it net revenue. In 2021, Stripe generated an estimate Gross Revenue of $12 billion and a Net Revenue of $2.5 billion—implying a net take-rate of roughly 39 bps.” (12) 
“Metrics are the most essential strategic asset of any marketplace, offering detailed insights into performance, growth trajectory, and areas that need improvement. Metrics provide the granular data that businesses need to make informed decisions about everything from operational changes to strategic pivots. In fact, companies that harness their data effectively are 6% more profitable than their less data-driven peers.” (13)

    1.	Gross Merchandise Value (GMV): The total value of goods or services sold on a platform before deducting any discounts, returns, or fees.
    2.	Net Revenue: The total revenue generated by a company after subtracting returns, discounts, and other deductions.
    3.	Take Rate: The percentage of GMV or total transaction value that a platform retains as revenue.
    4.	Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): The cost a business incurs to acquire a new customer, including marketing and advertising expenses.
    5.	Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): The predicted total revenue a business expects to earn from a customer throughout their entire relationship.
    6.	Active Users: The number of users who regularly engage with a product or service within a specific time frame.
